LED Cube
========

Code for a 8x8x8 LED cube, has a lame OpenGL based simulator
for trying out effects without burning them to the microcontroller.

Run `make` to compile, run ./main to run simulation.

This repository is currently only for technites kids to use.
I'm sure the code is of no use to anyone else.

TODO
====

Effects:
* Sine wave
* Random speckles
* Rain
* Send dot
... a lot more

Compilation:
* make msp should compile it for the msp
^ long way to go.
